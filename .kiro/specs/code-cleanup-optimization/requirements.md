# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive code cleanup and optimization for the Laravel-based gym machines website. The goal is to identify and remove unused code, eliminate duplicates, optimize imports and variables, and ensure the codebase follows best practices for maintainability and readability. This cleanup will improve performance, reduce bundle size, and make the codebase more maintainable for future development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and remove unused code throughout the application, so that the codebase is cleaner and more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused PHP classes, methods, and functions
2. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused JavaScript functions and variables
3. WHEN scanning the codebase THEN the system SHALL identify all unused CSS classes and styles
4. WHEN scanning Blade templates THEN the system SHALL identify unused template files and components
5. WHEN scanning configuration files THEN the system SHALL identify unused configuration options
6. IF code is confirmed as unused THEN the system SHALL safely remove it without breaking functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to detect and eliminate duplicate code blocks, so that the codebase follows DRY principles and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning PHP files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate methods and functions across classes
2. WHEN scanning Blade templates THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate HTML structures and suggest componentization
3. WHEN scanning JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate functions and logic blocks
4. WHEN scanning CSS files THEN the system SHALL identify duplicate style declarations
5. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL suggest reusable functions or components
6. IF duplicate code is refactored THEN the system SHALL ensure all references are updated correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove unused imports, variables, and functions, so that the code is cleaner and loads faster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning PHP files THEN the system SHALL identify unused use statements and imports
2. WHEN scanning JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL identify unused import statements
3. WHEN scanning PHP files THEN the system SHALL identify unused variables within methods and classes
4. WHEN scanning JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL identify unused variables and constants
5. WHEN scanning Blade templates THEN the system SHALL identify unused variables passed from controllers
6. IF unused elements are found THEN the system SHALL remove them safely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify files and sections that are not being used, so that they can be safely deleted to reduce project size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning the project THEN the system SHALL identify orphaned files not referenced anywhere
2. WHEN scanning routes THEN the system SHALL identify unused route definitions
3. WHEN scanning controllers THEN the system SHALL identify unused controller methods
4. WHEN scanning models THEN the system SHALL identify unused model classes
5. WHEN scanning assets THEN the system SHALL identify unused images, fonts, and other static files
6. WHEN scanning migrations THEN the system SHALL identify unused or redundant migration files
7. IF files are confirmed as unused THEN the system SHALL provide a safe deletion list

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cleaned code to follow Laravel and web development best practices, so that the codebase is consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring code THEN the system SHALL ensure PSR-12 coding standards are followed
2. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL ensure Laravel directory structure conventions are maintained
3. WHEN cleaning CSS THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent naming conventions and organization
4. WHEN cleaning JavaScript THEN the system SHALL ensure modern ES6+ practices are followed
5. WHEN cleaning Blade templates THEN the system SHALL ensure proper component structure and naming
6. WHEN optimizing code THEN the system SHALL maintain proper error handling and logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want a comprehensive summary report of cleanup activities, so that I can understand what was optimized and the impact on the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup is completed THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed summary report
2. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include counts of removed files, functions, and lines of code
3. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include estimated performance improvements
4. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include a list of refactored components and their benefits
5. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include recommendations for ongoing code maintenance
6. WHEN reporting THEN the system SHALL include any potential risks or areas requiring manual review
